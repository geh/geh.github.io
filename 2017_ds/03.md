% Stacks 

Due date: monday 3/7

 1. An input line contains a word consisting of lowercase letters only. Explain
    how a stack can be used to determine if the word is a palindrome.

 2. Implement Program P4.6 on a local C file, so that it compiles without
    warning with an up-to-date compiler like `gcc` or `clang` (not `tcc`).

 3. Modify Program P4.6 so that it works with any integer operands
    (as opposed with single-digit operands).
