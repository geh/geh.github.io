% Structures, pointers and linked lists

Due date: tuesday 27/6.

# 1. Pointers

 1. Answer the exercises 1 to 15 of Chapter 2.

 2. Start from the program given at <https://goo.gl/9VuMdX>

    Write a function `map` that takes as arguments:
    * an array of `int`
    * the size of the array given in `int`
    * a pointer to a function that takes an `int` and returns an `int`
    The function does not return any value.

    When given an array `a`and a function `f`, `map` replaces each element
    `a[i]` of array `a` by `f(a[i])`.  

    Write two functions `int plusOne(int)` and `int square(int)`.

    Add to the `main` fuction the required code to apply funcions `plusOne`
    and `square` to the array by using the `map` function.

    (There is no need to add `printf` statements since PythonTutor enables
    us to directly visualize the array).

# 2. Linked Lists

 1. Reimplement Program P3.1 in PythonTutor, doing the following changes:

    * as PythonTutor does not support program inputs, use the standard
      pseudorandom numbers generator instead of `scanf` to get random values
      between 0 and 9.
    * build a linked list of 4 elements
    * do not `printf` anything
    * Can you use only two pointers in the `main` function?
    * Add a function `freeLL` that frees the memory occupied by the linked list;
      use it.
