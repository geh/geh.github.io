% Binary Trees and Sorting algorithms

# Binary Trees

 1. Rewrite Program P5.2 with the following changes (use [wordFreq.in](wordFreq.in)):

    * the function `findOrInsert` shall handle
      properly the case of an empty binary tree
    * the while loop shall not have a conditionnal


 2. Rewrite Program P5.3 with the same changes
    (use [passage.in](passage.in)).

 3. Rewrite Program P5.7 so as to make it work in PythonTutor:

    * Replace input file by built-in array: `10 15 23 32 41 46 52 59 63 71 84`
    * Remove printing functions.
    * Add functions `numNodes`, `height` and `numLeaves`,
      apply them on the created tree and show their output
      on the standard output of the program

# Sorting

Start from the program at <https://goo.gl/LLFVpC>.

 1. Implement and use the functions `selecction_sort` and `gnome_sort`
    inside of PythonTutor.

 2. Modify this program so that, when run on your
    computer, it generates a PGM file that represent the state of the
    array after each swapping step, in both sorting functions.

    The [Netpbm format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format)
    is a family of simple image formats. If we use the format PGM
    (Portable GrayMap), we can visualize arrays as lines of grey pixels.

    Here goes an example of `.pgm` file:

    ~~~
    P2
    24 7
    15
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    0  3  3  3  3  0  0  7  7  7  7  0  0 11 11 11 11  0  0 15 15 15 15  0
    0  3  0  0  0  0  0  7  0  0  0  0  0 11  0  0  0  0  0 15  0  0 15  0
    0  3  3  3  0  0  0  7  7  7  0  0  0 11 11 11  0  0  0 15 15 15 15  0
    0  3  0  0  0  0  0  7  0  0  0  0  0 11  0  0  0  0  0 15  0  0  0  0
    0  3  0  0  0  0  0  7  7  7  7  0  0 11 11 11 11  0  0 15  0  0  0  0
    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
    ~~~

    If we open it with some image viewer and zoom in:

    ![ejemplo PGM](http://hub.darcs.net/gh/prog1/raw-file/contenidos/pgm.png)\ 

    Let us go through this file's format:

    * first line "P2" is obligatory and indicates the file type
    * second line indicates the number of **columns** and **lines**
    * third line indicates the maximum value that is going to be used
    * then comes the very picture, pixel by pixel

    Each pixel is specified by a value between 0 and the maximum value indicated
    at line 3. Intermediate values correspond to different shades of grey, from the
    darkest to the lightest one.

    If $n$ is the size of the arrays we are sorting, how many lines is going to have
    the image generated by our program? In which case (selection or gnome sort)
    do we know that quantity beforehand?

    a. Implement a the generation of images PGM inside of the previous program to
    visualize selection sort.

    To write one line to the PGM file, you can use the function:

    ~~~C
    void print_line_pgm(const int a[], const int size, FILE * f ){
        int k;
        for(k=0; k<size; k++){   
           fprintf(f,"%2d ", a[k]);
           if (k<size-1) fprintf(f," ",a[k]);
        }
        fprintf(f,"\n");
    }
    ~~~

    Try by raising the value of SIZE to 30, 50, etc.

    ![selection sort](http://hub.darcs.net/gh/prog1/raw-file/contenidos/selectionsort.png)\ 

    b. Add the required code also visualize the execution of `gnome_sort`.
