% Linked Lists and Stacks 

Due date: thursday 29/6.

# 1. Linked Lists

 1. Reimplenent Program P3.2 in PythonTutor. Again, modify it so that
    it creates a linked list of 5 nodes and contains random values.
    Also the program shall not print anything to standard output.

 2. Modify the previous program by implementing a function `reverse`
    that reverses the nodes of the linked list; use it in the `main` function
    on the existing linked list.
    Add a function `freeLL` that frees the memory occupied by the linked list;

# 2. Stacks

 1. Reimplement Program 4.2 (Stack implemented with a Linked List)
    in PythonTutor, adapting it the same way as we dit for the previous
    programs.
